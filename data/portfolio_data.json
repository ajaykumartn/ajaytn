      "title": "Real-Time Face Mask Detection",
      "short_desc": "A CNN model to detect face masks in live video, achieving 98% accuracy.",
      "image_url": "https://placehold.co/600x400/1a1a3d/c084fc?text=Project+1",
      "overview": "This project involves building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately identify whether a person in a live video feed is wearing a face mask. The goal was to create a fast and reliable system that could be deployed in public spaces to help enforce safety regulations.",
      "challenges": "One of the main challenges was handling false positives (e.g., a hand near the face being detected as a mask). This was addressed by refining the dataset and implementing a more complex CNN architecture with additional convolutional layers to better capture facial features.",

      "image_url": "https://placehold.co/600x400/1a1a3d/c084fc?text=Project+2",
      "overview": "This project showcases a recommendation engine built using collaborative filtering techniques. It analyzes user-item interaction data (movie ratings) to predict and recommend new movies to users, leveraging the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm for matrix factorization.",
      "challenges": "A key challenge was the sparsity of the user-item matrix. This was mitigated by using dimensionality reduction techniques inherent in SVD, allowing the model to find latent features and make more robust recommendations.",

      "image_url": "https://placehold.co/600x400/1a1a3d/c084fc?text=Project+3",
      "overview": "This Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focuses on classifying text sentiment. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units was trained on a large dataset of product reviews to determine whether the sentiment of a review is positive or negative.",
      "challenges": "Handling nuances of language like sarcasm and context was difficult. The solution involved using pre-trained word embeddings (like GloVe) to provide the model with a richer understanding of word semantics from the start.",

      "overview": "This project explores the creative application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The model learns to separate the content of an image from its artistic style, allowing it to recompose the original content image with the style of a different artwork.",
      "challenges": "Achieving stable training with GANs was the primary difficulty. This was overcome by implementing specific techniques like spectral normalization and using a well-structured discriminator and generator architecture (like CycleGAN).",

      "overview": "This tool condenses long articles into a few key sentences. It works by calculating the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) score for words, scoring sentences based on the weight of the words they contain, and selecting the top-scoring sentences to form the summary.",
      "challenges": "Ensuring the summary is coherent and grammatically correct was a challenge for this extractive method. While not perfect, the model's output was improved by ranking sentences not just by score but also by their original position in the text.",
